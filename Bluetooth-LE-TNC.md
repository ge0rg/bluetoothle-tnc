# Bluetooth LE / Bluetooth Smart TNC Protocol Design

This is a protocol specification for the Bluetooth LE based communication channel between an
[APRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Packet_Reporting_System) / Packet Radio client and a
[TNC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_node_controller).

The TNC is defined as a [GATT](https://developer.bluetooth.org/TechnologyOverview/Pages/GATT.aspx)
service profile that provides the following functions via individual GATT characteristics:

 * **TX** - transmit AX.25 packets (via *GATT write characteristic*)
 * **RX** - receive AX.25 packets (via *notify* followed by *read characteristic*)
 * **Diag** - receive TNC diagnostic messages (via *notify* followed by *read characteristic*)
 * **Vol** - receive the audio volume level on the TNC input (via *read characteristic* or *notify*)

Over radio, AX.25 frames are sent and received in APRS and Packet Radio. In (mostly serial)
host-to-TNC communication, these frames are usually encapsulated using the
[KISS](http://www.ax25.net/kiss.aspx) protocol that adds multiplexing, serialization, and framing.

This protocol design is using the KISS framing inside of Bluetooth characteristics for the following
reasons:

 * *Backward Compatibility*: a TNC is usually offering multiple client interfaces (USB serial;
   Bluetooth Serial Port Profile; Bluetooth Smart). Using the same encapsulation format on all
   interfaces reduces complexity.
 * *Framing*: it is possible to store multiple KISS frames in a single characteristic values,
   back-to-back, increasing the throughput on the slow Bluetooth LE channel.
 * *Configuration*: The KISS protocol allows to implement vendor-specific commands and status
   messages. These can be easily exchanged using the **RX**/**TX** characteristics.

## Basic Usage Patterns

Bluetooth LE GATT is a client-driven protocol. All interactions are initiated by the LE client (also
called *central*, most probably a smartphone), and the LE server (*peripheral*, the TNC) is the
responder.  The only means for the LE server to initiate a transmission is by means of the limited
*notify characteristic* mechanism, to which the client must explicitly subscribe.

The basic usage pattern for the TNC is as follows:

 * The LE client connects to the TNC (LE server with well-known Service UUID)
 * Client subscribes to **RX** and **Diag** (and optionally **Vol**) characteristics
 * Client transmits packets by issuing *write* to the **TX** characteristic
 * TNC informs the client of incoming packets / diag messages via *notify*
 * Client reads packets / diagnostic messages via *read* on the respective characteristic
 * The client can either poll **Vol** from time to time, or subscribe to notifications

## GATT Service and Characteristics

The TNC GATT service has the following well-defined UUID:

    ca1060dc-6fb0-4d48-b931-073ed111081b

This has been generated by a magic incantation of uuidgen, and shall be the master UUID for
Bluetooth LE based TNCs henceforth, by demand of the wise Bluetooth SIG wizards.

The TNC GATT service shall contain the following characteristics, with their UUIDs derived from the
service UUID:


 * 0000**0001**-6fb0-4d48-b931-073ed111081b **TX** - transmit packets (KISS format, *write* only)

 * 0000**0002**-6fb0-4d48-b931-073ed111081b **RX** - receive packets (KISS format, *read* and *notify*)

 * 0000**0003**-6fb0-4d48-b931-073ed111081b **Diag** - receive diagnostic messages from the TNC (UTF-8 strings, *read* and *notify*)

 * 0000**0004**-6fb0-4d48-b931-073ed111081b **Vol** - receive the audio volume on the TNC input (16-bit Little Endian, *read* and *notify*)

 * 0000**00ff**-6fb0-4d48-b931-073ed111081b **MTU** - enforce an MTU exchange initiated by the TNC

For **RX** and **Diag**, the *notify* packet only deliveres the MTU-sized prefix of the actual
message. Therefore, a follow-up *read* must be performed by the client.

## Transmitting AX.25 Packets

The client constructs a KISS frame and *write*s it to the **0001** characteristic (using **0001**
here as short form for 0000**0001**-6fb0-4d48-b931-073ed111081b). If the KISS frame exceeds the MTU,
the client splits it into a series of BLE *prepare-write* commands, followed by an *execute-write*.
While the BLE standard allows mixing *prepare-write*s to different characteristics, for the sake of
protocol simplicity this protocol limits batch writes to a single characteristic, and enforces
consecutiveness of the individual fragments.

After receiving the BLE *write* or *execute-write*, the TNC processes the KISS frame according to
its frame type. AX.25 packets are excracted and sent via RF, control frames are processed by the
TNC.

If the TNC's KISS transmission buffer is filled up, it can perform BLE-level flow control by
delaying the BLE *write response* acknowledgement to the client until sufficient buffer space is
freed up by processing/transmitting the frame obtained from the client.

*Optional: allow multiple KISS frames to be sent together (up to 512 bytes) by putting them
back-to-back into the characteristic.*

## Receiving over BLE

Bluetooth LE has only one way of server-initiated communication: *notify*.  A client must
"subscribe" to a characteristic to obtain *notify*s for it.  Therefore, to receive packets, the BLE
client subscribes to the RX/*notify* characteristic **0002**.

Generally, up to 512 Bytes can be delivered in a characteristic.  However, a *notify* is truncated
to the MTU size. As the client can not determine if a *notify* was truncated, it needs to perform a
series of *read* requests with increasing offsets to obtain the full charcteristic value. Generally,
the client starts with a *read* at offset 0, and performs follow-up *read*s with the offset
increased by the MTU, until it reaches 512 Bytes or receives a *read* response that is smaller than
the MTU. During this series of *read* requests, the characteristic value should be kept constant by
the server.

## Receiving KISS Frames

When the TNC receives a valid AX.25 frame over RF, it encapsulates it into a KISS frame, and sends a
*notify* with the first MTU bytes of that KISS frame. The TNC stores the full KISS frame in the
**0002** characteristic buffer. The BLE client, upon getting the *notify*, performs a series of
*read*s on **0002** until it obtains the complete KISS frame. If the TNC obtains an additional frame
in the meantime, it caches that frame in a separate buffer, and delays the *notify* until the client
has finished *read*ing the characteristic. After the client has finished reading, the old KISS frame
is discarded and the new one is stored in the **0002** characteristic buffer.

*Optional: allow multiple KISS frames to be sent together (up to 512 bytes) by putting them
back-to-back into the characteristic. Additional KISS frames can be added to the characteristic
buffer until the client's *read* has reached the buffer end, or the 512 byte characteristic size
would be exceeded. Only one *notify* needs to be sent for the aggregated KISS frames.*

## Diagnostics

The "Receiving over BLE" considerations also apply for the Diagnostics characteristic **0003**.
Diagnostic messages are UTF-8 strings (they may also contain newlines). There is no aggregation of
multiple messages, each message causes a *notify* and must be *read* by the client.

## Volume Level

The volume level (characteristic **0004**) is a 16-bit value ranging from 0x0000 (silence) to 0xffff
(maximum value) encoded in Little Endian byte order. The application may either *read* the
characteristic value whenever needed, or subscribe to it and receive *notify*s with the current
value.  The BLE server should balance its energy consumption with the user's demand for up-to-date
information, e.g. by only sending changes above a certain threshold, or by averaging the volume
level over a certain time (i.e. 0.5 seconds).

## MTU Exchange (Optional)

By default, Android clients do not perform an MTU exchange (and there is no client API to enforce it
prior to Android 5), thus leaving the default MTU of 22 bytes. To work around that, it is possible
for the BLE server to initiate an MTU exchange. However, having the server do that at a
server-controlled time can lead to race conditions (the MTU exchange changes the client's
expectations on the data amount for *read*/*write*s).

To allow for a serialized MTU exchange, an additional *read* characteristic **00ff** is proposed,
which is used by the client to let the server initiate an MTU exchange as follows:

1. Client sends *read* request on **00ff**
2. Server sends MTU request (with the maximum 512 Bytes value)
3. Client sends MTU response (hopefully also with 512 Bytes)
4. Server sends *read* response with a single data byte 0x00

## Discussion points

 - Use a different framing instead of KISS? I'm really open here, as
   long as it is practical to implement and has benefits. I could
   imagine some other mechanism, i.e. send a "packet count X" via *notify*
   and let the client *read* the RX characteristic X times, with each
   characteristic value representing one packet.

 - Multi-packet aggregation: With a large MTU (512 Bytes), we can
   significantly increase Android throughput by putting multiple packets
   into one characteristic. KISS comes handy here, but we could use
   another encoding as well (i.e: &lt;count>&lt;size>&lt;data>&lt;size>&lt;data>). The
   MTU on iOS is fixed to 157 Bytes, but they generally have a faster
   and more robust stack.

 - Timestamps: if you have some kind of RTC, you could add the packet's
   actual RX timestamp into the frame, so we could cleanly handle "old"
   packets. If you have no RTC, but a deep-sleep independent timer, we
   could use a relative timestamp (e.g. the packet's age in milliseconds
   at the time of querying the characteristic). The BLE client could
   then do the math to convert it into an absolute time.

 - Flow control: the TNC could perform flow-control by delaying the *write response* for each
   outgoing AX.25 packet until the packet has been transmitted OTA. That would allow the host to
   have very fine-grained feedback about the timing of transmissions, however it would prevent the
   back-to-back transmission of multiple packets queued in the TNC.
